# Getting Started with Rocket Science

This project is a 'converter' that converts a list of inefficeint items to distance it can propel. I love space and rockets and so I thought that this would be a fun thing to do. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `PORT=8000 npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Start API

cd into `backend` in a new terminal and run `rails s` to start your backend server.
This will let you recieve the proper info and store and let the program run appropietly
